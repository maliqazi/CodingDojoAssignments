                 <p id="p_main_content">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented, scripting language.
                   JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small
                   and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
                   take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
                   (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                   to provide programmatic control over them.

                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables
                         are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fillwith coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                         a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique
                         names are called identifiers. <span class="js_s_l_main_content">var x;</span>
                     </li>
                     <li class="l_main_content">
                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to
                         JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                         The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="js_s_l_main_content">var x=10;</span>
                     </li>
                     <li class="l_main_content">
                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
                         variables you need to know the data type. There are six data byptes that are JavaScript primitives:
                         Boolean - <span class="js_s_l_main_content">true</span> or <span class="js_s_l_main_content">false;</span> null -
                         <span class="js_s_l_main_content">null</span> aka nothing; Number <span class="js_s_l_main_content">42</span> or
                         <span class="js_s_l_main_content">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="js_s_l_main_content">Coding Dojo Rocks!";"
                         </span> Array - <span class="js_s_l_main_content">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span
                         class="js_s_l_main_content">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>

                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions
                         for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
                         You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                         statements: <span class="js_s_l_main_content">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our
                         code block; <span class="js_s_l_main_content">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the
                         first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                     </li>
                     <li class="l_main_content">
                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in eery programming
                         language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
                         Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                     </li>
                     <li class="l_main_content">
                         <span class="s_l_main_content">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When
                         we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example
                         imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
                         first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
                         our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tales to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
